= New Features

* The hmac_paths plugin now supports :until and :seconds options for
  hmac_path, to create a path that is only valid for a specific amount of
  time.  :until sets a specific time that the path will be valid until,
  and :seconds makes the path only valid for the given number of seconds.

    hmac_path('/widget/1', until: Time.utc(2100))
    # =>  "/dc8b6e56e4cbe7815df7880d42f0e02956b2e4c49881b6060ceb0e49745a540d/t/4102444800/widget/1"

  Requests for the path after the given time will not be matched by
  r.hmac_path.

= Other Improvements

* The early_hints plugin now correctly follows the Rack 3 SPEC when
  using Rack 3.  This was not caught previously because Rack only
  added official support for early_hints in the last month.

* Ruby 3.4 backtraces are now parsed correctly in the exception_page
  plugin.

* Some plugins that accept a block no longer issue an unused block
  warning on Ruby 3.4.
