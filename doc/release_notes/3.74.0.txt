= New Features

* A redirect_http_to_https plugin has been added, redirecting HTTP
  requests to the same path on an HTTPS site.  Using the routing tree,
  you can control where to do the redirection, which allows you to
  easily have part of your site accessible via HTTP, with sensitive
  sections requiring HTTPS:

    plugin :redirect_http_to_https

    route do |r|
      # routes available via both HTTP and HTTPS
      r.redirect_http_to_https
      # routes available only via HTTPS
    end

  If you want to redirect to HTTPS for all routes in the routing tree, you
  can have r.redirect_http_to_https as the very first method call in the
  routing tree.  Note that in Roda it is possible to handle routing before
  the normal routing tree using before hooks.  The static_routing and
  heartbeat plugins use this feature. If you would like to handle routes
  before the normal routing tree, you can setup a before hook:

    plugin :hooks

    before do
      request.redirect_http_to_https
    end
