= New Feature

* A match_hook_args plugin has been added.  This is similar to the
  existing match_hook plugin, but passes through the matchers and
  block arguments (values yielded to the match block). Example:

    plugin :match_hook_args
 
    add_match_hook do |matchers, block_args|
      logger.debug("matchers: #{matchers.inspect}. #{block_args.inspect} yielded.")
    end

    # Term is an implicit matcher used for terminating matches, and
    # will be included in the array of matchers yielded to the match hook
    # if a terminating match is used.
    term = self.class::RodaRequest::TERM

    route do |r|
      r.root do
        # for a request for /
        # matchers: nil, block_args: nil
      end

      r.on 'a', ['b', 'c'], Integer do |segment, id|
        # for a request for /a/b/1
        # matchers: ["a", ["b", "c"], Integer], block_args: ["b", 1]
      end

      r.get 'd' do
        # for a request for /d
        # matchers: ["d", term], block_args: []
      end
    end
