= New Features

* The middleware plugin now accepts a :next_if_not_found option.
  This allows the middleware plugin to pass the request to the next
  application if the current application handles the request but
  ends up calling the not_found handler.  With the following
  middleware:

    class Mid < Roda
      plugin :middleware

      route do |r|
        r.on "foo" do
          r.get "bar" do
            'bar'
          end
        end
      end
    end

  Requests for /x would be forwarded to the next application, since
  the application doesn't handle the request, but requests for /foo/x
  would not be, because the middleware is partially handling the
  request in the r.on "foo" block.  With the :next_if_not_found
  option, only requests for /foo/bar would be handled by the
  middleware, and all other requests would be forwarded to the next
  application.

= Other Improvements

* The sessions and route_csrf plugins no longer depend on the base64
  library. base64 will be removed from Ruby's standard library
  starting in Ruby 3.4.
