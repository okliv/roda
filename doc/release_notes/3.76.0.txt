= New Features

* A break plugin has been added, allowing you to use break from
  inside a routing block and continue routing after the block.  This
  offers the same feature as the pass plugin, but using the standard
  break keyword instead of the r.pass method.

* The error_mail and error_email features now both accept a :filter
  plugin option.  The value should respond to call with two arguments.
  The first arguments is the key, and the second is the value, and
  should return a truthy value if the value should be filtered.  This
  will be used for filtering parameter values, ENV values, and session
  values in the generated emails.

= Other Improvements

* On Ruby 3.3+, the middleware plugin sets a temporary class name for
  the created middleware, based on the class name of the Roda app.
