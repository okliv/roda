= New Features

* A plain_hash_response_headers plugin has been added.  On Rack 3,
  this changes Roda to use a plain hash for response headers (as it
  does on Rack 2), instead of using Rack::Headers (the default on
  Rack 3).  For a minimal app, using this plugin can almost double
  the performance on Rack 3.  Before using this plugin, you should
  make sure that all response headers set explictly in your
  application are already lower-case.

= Improvements

* Roda now natively uses lower-case for all response headers set
  implicitly when using Rack 3.  Previously, Roda used mixed-case
  response headers and had Rack::Headers handle the conversion to
  lower-case (Rack 3 requires lower-case response headers). Note
  that Rack::Headers is still used for response headers by default
  on Rack 3, as applications may not have converted to using
  lower-case response headers.
