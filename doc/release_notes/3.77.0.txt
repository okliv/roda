= New Features

* The route_csrf plugin now supports formaction/formmethod attributes
  in forms. A csrf_formaction_tag method has been added for creating
  a hidden input for a particular path and method.  When a form is
  submitted, the check_csrf! method will fix check for a path-specific
  csrf token (set by the hidden tag added by the csrf_formaction_tag
  method), before checking for the default csrf token.
