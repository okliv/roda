= New Features

* A render_coverage plugin has been added, which will cause compiled
  template code to be saved to a folder and loaded using load instead
  of eval. This allows for coverage to work for the compiled template
  code in Ruby versions before 3.2.  It can also allow for verbose
  syntax warnings in compiled template code (ignored by eval), and
  can also be useful for static analysis of compiled template code.
  This plugin requires tilt 2.1+.

* The exception_page plugin now supports exception_page_{css,js}
  instance methods for overriding the CSS and JavaScript on the
  generated exception page.

= Other Improvements

* Using inline templates (render/view :inline option) no longer keeps
  a reference to the Roda instance that caches the template.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The Render::TemplateMtimeWrapper API has changed.  Any external
  use of this class needs to be updated.
